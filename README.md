# simpleXcpp
A simple action platformer in C++ and SFML, with the idea to make it become a metroidvania sooner or later.<br>
After seeing the limitation of [Javascript](https://github.com/fibreditoniocartonio/simpleXjs), I decided to port simpleX in C++.

## Building
Clone this repo and run the script compile.sh. The script requires bash and g++, in the future I will use something more compatible with other platform.

## Assets
I'm not a good artist and to speed up the development of the game engine I'm currently using some assets non-conforming to the GPL3 License.<br>
If you are an artist and want to contribute with some beautiful free assets you can contact me on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7dEmHX39bA), when I'll have enough free assets I will remove all the non-conforming ones.

If you have some spare money and want to donate, donate to charities and to those who are in need.
